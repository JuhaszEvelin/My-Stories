# My-Stories
This project is aimed at me trying and mastering new technologies, design patterns and writing well performing business logic. 
I was always interested on Spring Framework during my education and I was very sad that we did'nt learned about it so I decided to start the project with Spring boot to learn and make quickly a working project - after set ups I would like to implement my own controllers and servlets to see inner processes.

Please note that this is a learner project, I never learned any Framework like this before and how to design and architect a web service so this project can change upon my knowledge and interest day to day.
